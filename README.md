Pewlett-Hackard is a company that has been in business for many years, like its seniority it also has many employees who are about to reach retirement. Therefore, the company has started a process of hiring new employees, but they need to know how many vacancies will be open and the positions to consider.
To provide this data we had to find these employees, based on their date of birth.

## Results:

- Departments
- Managers
- Employees
- Employees by department
- Salaries
- Titles.

And we link between them the information contained in each of these structures as shown below:
